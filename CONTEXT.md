# AgentStart context

**The fleet** — the agent apps in `~/code` whose checkouts are named
`agent*` — `agentguidance` carries the general skills — plus `cass` from
`agentchats` and `peekaboo` from `agentdesk`.
Each fleet repo owns its own hardened installer and exports its own skills;
AgentStart invokes contracts and never reaches inside a sibling checkout.
_Avoid_: suite, monorepo, workspace.

**The boundary rubric** — the one-sentence ownership test for this
repository: depended on by or deeply related to the fleet → AgentStart; the
machine itself (Homebrew, Stow, launchd, macOS settings, account migration)
→ the machine layer, which this repository does not own and does not name.
_Avoid_: split, refactor, migration (those name the event; the rubric names
the rule).

**The toolchain** — everything `scripts/install.sh --install` converges:
harness CLIs, pinned npm globals, MCP registration, guidance links,
extension prompts, and every skill in the private core plugin. The AI *desktop
applications* are not toolchain; they are Homebrew casks, and the machine's.
_Avoid_: stack, setup.

**Harness** — an agent CLI a session runs inside: Claude Code, Codex, Pi, Fx.
Skills install into harnesses; AgentLaunch shims balance their bare
launches. _Avoid_: agent (ambiguous with the fleet apps), IDE.

**Extension prompts** — the operator's `SYSTEM.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`, and
`TOOLS.md` under `prompts/agentguidance/`, linked into
`~/.config/agentguidance` and rendered by agentguidance into the
collab/build skills. Their three names are agentguidance's contract; an
unrecognized file renders to nothing. _Avoid_:
config files, dotfiles.

**Advertisement** — a tool's one line in `TOOLS.md` saying when to load its
skill. A line is attention spent in every session and has to earn it; the
policy and its standing decisions live in the wiki
(`agentwiki get tool-advertisement-policy`). _Avoid_: documentation,
listing (an installed, unadvertised tool is still fully documented by its
skill).

**The sync path** — `scripts/sync-skills`: the unattended-safe convergence
the scheduled updater runs every six hours — the participant scan into the
private `agentstart-core` plugin, plugin cache refresh, no elevation, no
compatibility-root cleanup, no restarts. _Avoid_: update, upgrade (binaries
never move on this path).

**The core plugin** — the one managed skill tree under
`~/.local/share/agentstart/core-marketplace/plugins/agentstart-core/skills`.
Claude Code and Codex consume it as a plugin, so their names are qualified by
`agentstart-core`: `$agentstart-core:<name>` in Codex and
`/agentstart-core:<name>` in Claude Code. Pi links the same directories under
its harness-only skill root and invokes `/<name>`. Codex-specific default
prompts are qualified when the plugin artifact is packaged; portable source
manifests stay plain. Fx scans none of those sources. _Avoid_: global skills,
shared skills (those names imply the compatibility roots this design retired).

**The Herdr config render** — the live `~/.config/herdr/config.toml` rendered
by AgentStart from its tracked behavior config, which carries no palette.
`herdr-config` validates and replaces the live file, so neither checkout
becomes program-written state; it is rendered rather than linked because Herdr
writes its own keys into it.
_Avoid_: dotfile, theme config (the render sets no colors at all).

**Participant** — an `agent*` checkout that exports
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and is therefore discovered by the scan. A
checkout without one is not misconfigured; it is simply not a participant.
This repository is itself a participant (the `fleet` skill). _Avoid_:
registered, enrolled (there is no registry — the convention is the whole
interface).
