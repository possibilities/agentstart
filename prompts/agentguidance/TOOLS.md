## Tools

Local capabilities, each delivered as an agent skill. The skill is the
runbook — it teaches the tool underneath — so load the named skill before
a session's first real use of that capability. These lines exist only to
say when.

- `search` — live web research for a cited answer or source links: "look
  this up", a fact newer than training, a claim that needs an outside
  source. Paid per call, so load the skill before the first one.
- `scrape` — you have a URL and want what is on it: the page as Markdown,
  its links, a timeline, a feed. Load before fetching anything you hold a
  URL for.
- `brain` — the research already collected on this machine, searchable
  offline. Load before any web search — the answer is often already local
  — and when something is worth keeping.
- `browser` — a real, signed-in browser for interaction: clicking, forms,
  anything behind a login, handing control to a human. Fetching content is
  `scrape`; finding pages is `search`.
- `attention` — durable human handoff for questions, document approval, and
  interaction with an exact Agentbrowse Browser target. Load when work needs a
  human, when several handoffs should be queued before one wait, or when a
  stale handoff must be rebuilt and submitted again.
- `desktop` — the Mac's screen and native apps: capturing what is visible,
  verifying GUI state, clicking, typing, menus, windows — GUI work outside
  a web page. Inside a web page is `browser`.
- `terminal-control` — real terminal applications: operating or testing a
  TUI, REPL, interactive CLI, shell process, or OpenTUI application.
- `wiki` — the operator's library: documents asked for or worth finding
  again by name — research, reports, decisions, designs — plus finding
  where something was written down and publishing citable artifacts.
  Working state and successor-session context are `~/handoffs/` files,
  not wiki pages.
- `board` — the shared plan: capturing work, asking what to do next,
  claiming an item before starting and closing it when done.
- `groom` — reshaping the plan in bulk: merging duplicates, splitting an
  epic, re-planning. Several board changes at once is `groom`, not
  `board`.
- `chats` — every past Claude Code and Codex session on this machine: load
  when a bug, error, or decision feels familiar, or to reconstruct what an
  earlier session did.
- `bus` — messaging another live agent on this machine's surface: telling
  a peer session something, asking one a question, or replying when a
  message "sent over the agent message bus" arrives. Delivery types into
  the peer's harness like the operator would; the skill covers who is
  reachable and what delivery does and does not promise.
- `notify` — reach the human when they are away from the terminal: work
  they are waiting on is done, or something has stalled and needs them.
