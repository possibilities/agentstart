## Guidelines

- In someone else's checkout (`~/src`), orient before working: confirm the
  branch is the one the task means — the default, or our fork's branch when
  we carry patches — then pull and fast-forward. A genuinely diverged
  branch is reported, not resolved in passing.
- A fork we patch is owned by a workshop repository (`fxnk` for Fx, `zmax`
  for zmx): its `MAINTAIN.md` is the contract for that fork, `/maintain` the
  procedure, and `integration` the only ref a consumer binds — through the
  workshop's own consumer step, never by hand. Upstream pull requests are
  evidence, not dependencies, and nothing moves their branches in passing.
  The `fork-rebase-policy` wiki page is the overview, not the contract.
- Worktrees and branches belong to the orchestrator that starts sessions:
  work where you were started, and say so when the task needs topology you
  were not given.
- Build forward: the new shape replaces the old. Shims, deprecation
  windows, and migrations are opt-in — name what breaks and for whom
  before a breaking change lands; the softer path is asked for, never
  assumed.
- Repository guidance is `AGENTS.md` at the repo root, with `CLAUDE.md` a
  symlink to it — or, where tooling refuses tracked symlinks, a short
  pointer file naming `AGENTS.md`; never a second set of instructions.
- Route documents by reader and lifetime: asked-for documents and ruling
  decisions go to the wiki, the repo keeps what it owns (`AGENTS.md`,
  `CONTEXT.md`, `README`, ADRs, the docs that ship with the code), and
  successor-session context is a dated `~/handoffs/` file, deleted by its
  consumer. The `document-placement-policy` wiki page is the contract.
- Publish an artifact only when asked for one, and always through `wiki`,
  never a harness's own artifact publisher.
- Cap searches at the source, not the reader: `grep -m N`, not `| head`,
  and `< /dev/null` on a grep inside a `while read` loop — some harness
  grep engines outlive the pipe and eat the loop's stdin.
- A clipboard copy leaves nothing on screen, so notify what landed there.
- Mint a new project with `ghinit`: run it bare from inside the new
  directory directly under `~/code`, or pass a name and it creates
  `~/code/<name>` first. Either way it initializes the repository and
  binds a private GitHub origin with the first push — never hand-assemble
  `git init` and `gh repo create`.
- Finished work lands in main and is pushed — a worktree is where work
  happens, not where it stops. A pull request is a workflow to be asked
  for by name, not a default.
- A fleet full-screen TUI follows the Signal Room design language. Before
  building or reshaping one, read the `fleet-tui-design` wiki page — the
  shell contract: chromeless, with no header, footer, identity row, or
  help line; status inside the instrument's panels; every action in the
  ctrl+k command palette — and the design-language page it opens with,
  for the tokens and their law. The contracts live there, not here.
